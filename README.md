## Getting started with your documentation

This guideline and its template are available for you and your team to follow as a reference in the process of developing your project.
  
To get started with your documentation, you can [use this template](https://github.com/OPEN-NEXT/WP2.3-Guidelines-and-templates-for-documentation-of-OSH-design-reuse/tree/main/Documentation%20of%20OSH%20design%20according%20to%20development%20activities)

Then, to reference this guideline, you can follow the guideline and then fill the template in each section in your own Project's readme.

At first, you should identify your needs for documentation. These needs are represented as development activities in the guideline for creating the documentation. Then, according to your required development activities, you can fill the corresponded templates of documentation blocks

Moreover, you can utilize the link of the App diagram in the template and fill the information of your product in the tables or create your representations as a graph or tree.

To use the link of the App diagram in the template, you can follow these steps to create your own project's table, graph or, tree.

 - At first, use the link "Edit As New" or "Edit in diagrams.net" to go to App diagram.
 - Then, you can modify the text, table, tree, or graph (image below).
